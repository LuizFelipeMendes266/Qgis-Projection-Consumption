### Project Description:

In this project, we will be analyzing and building a graphical representation of the consumption of regions and properties in the city of Campinas Brazil.

### Data:

The expense data comes from the Consumer Price Index (IPC), with the file name 'prediction-expense-by-census-tract'. The census tracts come from IBGE, with the shapefiles named '35SEE250GC_SIR'. Finally, we have the data for the Property Tax Information Return (IPTU) for the city of Campinas.

### Methods:

In a nutshell, we will be cross-referencing data between the IPC dataset and the IBGE dataset, and finally, we will cross-reference this information with the IPTU data. The steps are described in the notebook.

### Tools and Technologies:

This project was developed using the following tools and technologies:
- Python 3: A programming language used for data analysis and machine learning.
- Pandas: A popular data manipulation and analysis library.
- GeoPandas: A Python library used to work with geospatial data.
- Regular Expressions (RegEx): A sequence of characters used to match patterns in text data.
- QGIS: A free and open-source desktop GIS (Geographic Information System) software.

### Results:

We found that the most common beauty product categories reviewed were skincare, haircare, and makeup. The majority of the reviews were positive, with an average rating of 4.3 out of 5 stars. The most commonly mentioned positive attributes of the products were effectiveness and ease of use, while the most commonly mentioned negative attribute was price.

### Conclusion:

Overall, our analysis showed that customers generally have positive sentiments towards beauty products, with effectiveness and ease of use being the most important factors. Price was identified as a potential barrier to customer satisfaction, suggesting that companies should consider pricing strategies that align with customer expectations.
